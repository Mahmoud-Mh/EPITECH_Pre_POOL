# Task 1.1: Evaluate and explain each expression
print(42 > 12)  # True, because 42 is greater than 12
# print(12 = 12)  # SyntaxError: '=' is for assignment, not comparison
print(12 == 12)  # True, correct comparison operator for equality
print("hello" == "world")  # False, "hello" is not equal to "world"
print(218 >= 118)  # True, 218 is greater than or equal to 118
print("a".upper() == "A")  # True, 'a' uppercased is "A"
print(1 * 2 * 3 * 4 <= 9)  # True, 1*2*3*4 = 24, and 24 is not less than or equal to 9
print("z" in "azerty")  # True, 'z' is part of the string "azerty"
