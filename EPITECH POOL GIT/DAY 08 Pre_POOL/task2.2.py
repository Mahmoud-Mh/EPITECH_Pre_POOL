# Task 2.2
# Let's explain the following code snippet and what it does:
# 
# import turtle
# toto = turtle.Screen()
# toto.bgcolor("black")
# titi = turtle.Turtle()
# titi.color("red")
# for i in range(3):
#     titi.right(90)
#     titi.circle(42)
# toto.exitonclick()

# Explanation:
# This code sets up a turtle graphics window with a black background.
# It creates a turtle named 'titi' that draws in red.
# The turtle turns right 90 degrees three times while drawing a quarter-circle (a semicircle) each time.
# The result is a pattern of semicircles, and you can exit the window by clicking.
